For the rest of your life.<br>
Walks into your life. </font></i> <br> <br>

All you can do...<br>
Is hope that one day, <br>
If that person really was the one. <br>
You will meet again. </b>

You get that second chance,<br>
Remember the past.<br>
Learn from your mistakes,<br>
And never let them happen again.<br>
